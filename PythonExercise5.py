Write a function(s) to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes  

This algorithm is used to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer \verb+n+.  

You should write 2 functions.  One function should implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm using a list stored as a global variable.  The second function should print whether the given integer is prime or not prime by using the generated list from the first function
